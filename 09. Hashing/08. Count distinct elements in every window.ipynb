    "The trick is to use the count of the previous window while sliding the window. To do this a hash map can be used that stores elements of the current window. The hash-map is also operated on by simultaneous addition and removal of an element while keeping track of distinct elements. The problem deals with finding the count of distinct elements in a window of length k, at any step while shifting the window and discarding all the computation done in the previous step, even though k – 1 elements are same from the previous adjacent window. For example, assume that elements from index i to i + k – 1 are stored in a Hash Map as an element-frequency pair. So, while updating the Hash Map in range i + 1 to i + k, reduce the frequency of the i-th element by 1 and increase the frequency of (i + k)-th element by 1.\n",
